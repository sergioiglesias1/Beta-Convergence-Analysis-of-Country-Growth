# Beta-Convergence-Analysis-of-Country-Growth
In this project, I investigate β-convergence by comparing emerging and developed countries over multiple periods (2004-2024) and country groups (developed or emerging). By calculating regression coefficients and R² values, I assess whether convergence occurs and how it differs between country groups.
